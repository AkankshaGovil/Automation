Outstanding Bugs That May Affect You
------------------------------------
	11694	CoreWatcher currently watches hardcoded 
		directories. When MSW implements configurable 
		path, it may break the current appproach and 
		we will have to adapt.

NexTest Tickets
---------------
	11864	Gen session is not killed
		Removed infinite loops in session.py, 
		made indentation changes.

	12313	Remove IWF tests in calltransfer suite
		Changed iwf.qms to iwf.qmsTMP

	11802	Mirrorproxy tests do not work on Linux
		Changed phone numbers to be unique.

	11801	checkiedge script does not work on Linux
		Changed: #!/usr/local/bin/bash to
		#!/usr/bin/env bash
		thereby ensuring platform interoperability.

	11697	README file contains /etc/hosts innacuracies
		Updated README, updated /etc/host sample, added comments

	11662	prodtest date stamp 1 minute diferent than results
		Added check for proximity to minute boundary, sleep 
		10 sec if more than 52 sec.

	11636	CoreWatcher may not work in Linux
		1st pass just 2 hard-coded paths:
		/var/core for SunOS
		/usr/local/nextone/bin for Linux
		This is a temp fix. 11694 was created for a 
		prem fix, dependent on as-yet
		undetermined MSW behavior.

	11625	NEXTEST 3.2d2 Linux; h323gen does not terminate when
		Ashish Jain ID'd need to expect extra prompt. I added 
		that code and code to only try to SIGINT 10 times, 
		then SIGKILL, replacing infinite loop in session.py

	11191	Add an option to get next pool id
		Added an option to get next pool id to ease provision for 
		Interroute. Fixed the issue with configuring pools with 
		Hot-Knife. 

	10489	Nextest install script (Solaris) has error msg
		Error msg caused by lack of LD_LIBRARY_PATH un sudo 
		environment, upon which python depends. According 
		to sudo and su man pages, all LD_* env variables are 
		automatically stripped from the environment. Fix was 
		to explicitly export LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the 
		install.sh script.

Outstanding Bugs That May Affect You
------------------------------------

	8876 	Network aliases disappear after reboot

	(See ticket for workaround.)


Test Suites, TDB oganisation (new in r3-2d)
-------------------------------------------
	The production_components directory suite is a reorganisation 
	of these previous suites: 

		* causecode
		* functional
		* nat
		* sipt
		* obp
		* mirrorproxy

	The reorganisation consisted of creating a new "directory"
	suite: production_components, moving the above-mentioned
	suites into it, and modifying all provisioning scripts to
	use an environment common to all suites. The purpose of
	this was to reduce the number of database cleanings and
	iServer re-starts, thereby making the execution of the
	production suite more stable. Moving forward, as new suites
	are introduced, they must be written in such a way as to
	make future integration with the production suite as easy as
	possible. 

	The logical suite: production was modified to invoke the new
	common provisioning test, and all suites located in 
	production_components directory.

	Another new "directory" suite was created: obsolete. For 
	clarity, all obsolete suites were moved there. These were 
	the obsolete suites so located: 

		* dmalloc.qms
		* h323.qms
		* iwf.qms
		* perf.qms
		* scm.qms
		* sip.qms

MSW Configuration Notes
-----------------------

	NexTest now requires that CDRs be stored in "fixed" file
	format, rather than "daily".  If you did not install/upgrade
	the MSW with this option set, do the following:

		1) change to /usr/local/nextone/bin

		2) run 'sconfig'

		3) Billing -> CDR File Format -> "fixed"

		4) run 'iserver all reconfig'

	You MUST add an entry for qanextest.com in the /etc/hosts
	file as follows.  The IP address should match that of
	dynamicrealm and prv_rsa. The entry should include the 
	dot-terminated FQDN. 

	Example:

		10.1.3.138  qanextest.com qanextest.com.

Call Gen System Setup
---------------------

	The installation script does not prompt for the qanextest.com
	address.  Enter the same line in the call gen /etc/hosts file
	as described the MSW Configuration Notes above.

NexTest Support for SuSE 9.1
----------------------------

	The NexTest framework and all tests developed for iServer
	release 3.1.1 have been ported to the SuSE 9.1 Linux system.
	Most of the code adapts to the underlying OS automatically and
	requires no user action.  Because of install peculiarities,
	however, two separate distributions will be maintained; the
	system administrator should choose the "SunOS" or "Linux"
	distro.

	See the companion document README.SuSE91 for Linux
	installation instructions.

IP Address Resolution
---------------------

	The remap function is obsolete in version 3.1.1r.  This step
	was necessary in past releases so that built-in IP addresses
	could be changed to fit the test environment.

	In 3.1.1r, the installation procedure prompts the installer
	for all necessary IP addresses.  Local IP aliases (also known
	as "logical interfaces") are set up at install time and are no
	longer dynamically managed by the test framework.

	In addition to setting up the aliases, the /etc/hosts file is
	updated so that all names will be resolved correctly.  There
	are no longer any IP addresses specified in the newer test
	suites.

	It is important that you define the "mymsw" IP address to that
	of the management interface on your MSW.

	You must define the "qanextest.com" and "qanextest.com."
	addresses manually on the MSW.  These names and associated IP
	addresses should be added to /etc/hosts so that the SIP
	dial-by-URI tests work.

	Some of the IP addresses are multiply defined - i.e., an IP
	address may be mapped to multiple names.  This is normal.

	Here is a sample from a working test system to guide you:

	    #
	    # Internet host table
	    #
	    127.0.0.1       localhost       loghost
	    #
	    # The MSW:
	    10.1.2.130      mymsw pub_rsa staticrealm
	    10.1.3.130      prv_rsa dynamicrealm qanextest.com qanextest.com.
	    #
	    # The gen:
	    10.1.2.142      interface-e1000g0 
	    10.1.3.142      interface-e1000g1 
	    10.1.3.148      qanextest.com qanextest.com.
	    #
	    # Written by NexTest install:
	    # (Except where shown, EP addresses should be unique)
	    10.1.2.142      public1 mygen pub_nat pub_ep
	    10.1.2.143      public2
	    10.1.2.144      sipproxy
	    10.1.2.145      seattle
	    10.1.2.146      portland
	    10.1.2.147      newyork
	    10.1.2.148      boston
	    10.1.3.142      private1 prv_nat prv_nat prv_ep
	    10.1.3.143      private2
	    10.1.3.144      sandiego
	    10.1.3.145      phoenix
	    10.1.3.146      atlanta
	    10.1.3.147      miami
	    #
	    10.1.2.1        defaultrouter

SIP Outbound and Mirror Proxy Setup Notes
-----------------------------------------

	The mirrorproxy and obp suites require that a third-party SIP
	proxy runs on the call generator.  Perform the following steps
	at install time.

	1. Define sipproxy address in /etc/hosts on the call generator

	2. Respond affirmatively when the installer asks if you want 
	   to run the SIP Express Router (ser).

	The MSW must be in SIP OBP mode for the obp and mirrorproxy
	tests.  For this release, you must run the 'sconfig' command
	manually before running either suite.  You should run sconfig
	again to return to 'stateful' mode afterward.

	This function is currently automated in nextest.


Here is the procedure to configure NAT on Linux:
------------------------------------------------

	1. Create the following interfaces

		ip addr add dev eth0 192.168.0.100/24
		ip addr add dev eth0 192.168.0.101/24
		ip addr add dev eth1 192.168.1.100/24
		ip addr add dev eth1 192.168.1.101/24

	2. Add two host names into /etc/hosts file. (Usually it is best 
	   to do this by configuring the network during NexTest 
	   installation. Take defaults unless a specific alternative 
	   configuration is sought.)

		10.1.2.182 pub_nat # private nat ip address
		10.1.3.182 prv_nat #  public nat ip address

	3. Run the following command for setting on Source-NAT on Linux. 
	   Thee iptables command must be run as root, not sudo. 
	   Replace <public nat ip address> and <private nat ip address> 
	   with public and private IP address of the Call Generator.

		iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p udp -s 192.168.0.100/24 -j SNAT --to-source <public nat ip address>:20000-29999
		iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p udp -s 192.168.1.100/24 -j SNAT --to-source <private nat ip address>:30000-39999


NAT Traversal Setup Notes - SOLARIS ONLY
----------------------------------------

	NOTE: the nat suite has not been ported to work with a Linux call
	gen in this release.

	Plumb interfaces e1000g0 and e1000g1 as follows:

	      ifconfig e1000g0 addif 192.168.0.100/24 up
	      ifconfig e1000g0 addif 192.168.0.101/24 up
	      ifconfig e1000g1 addif 192.168.1.100/24 up
	      ifconfig e1000g1 addif 192.168.1.101/24 up

	Change to the /opt/nextest/etc directory

	     cd /opt/nextest/etc/

	Remove the old NSF package with

	     pkgrm nsf

	Add the new package with

	     pkgadd -d ipfilter_3.4.27_stock.pkg

	Edit the ipnat configuration file /etc/opt/ipf/ipnat.conf 
	and include the following two network address mappings:

   		map e1000g0 192.168.0.0/24 -> 10.1.0.62/32 portmap udp 20001:30000
   		map e1000g1 192.168.1.0/24 -> 10.1.1.62/32 portmap udp 30001:40000

      	Note: Replace the NAT IP address 10.1.0.62 and 10.1.1.62 with 
	correct IP address of the Solaris machine

	Stop and start ipfilter with

     		/etc/init.d/ipfboot stop
     		/etc/init.d/ipfboot start

	Check the IP address mappings with

      		ipnat -l

	The output would be like the following:

    		List of active MAP/Redirect filters:
    		map e1000g0 192.168.0.0/24 -> 10.1.0.62/32 portmap udp 20001:30000
    		map e1000g1 192.168.1.0/24 -> 10.1.1.62/32 portmap udp 30001:40000

    		List of active sessions:

	The NAT setup should not negatively impact other tests.  It
	simply replaces the NSF driver with the original Solaris
	version.
