Perl-style options may be passed as a hash reference.  Thanks to Greg Ward
for the suggestion.  There is a limited test suite as well.

You may now specify your own output functions.  Your custom function is called
for each line of output.  The line is the first argument to the function.  The
second argument is either 'err' or 'out' so the same function may be used for
both and can determine where the line came from.  Thanks to Boris Goldowsky
for the suggestion.

James Mello pointed out that if no destination is given, rsync prints a list
of files that would be processed.  To that end, a list function has been added.

Since I have gotten various reports (and some good improvements) from people
using this module, and no real problems, I will be bumping the version number
to 1.0 soon unless someone finds problems.  As always, suggestions for
improvement are always greatly appreciated.

Thanks to Andreas Keonig for explaining how to get this into the by-module
listing properly, and helping me avoid possible problems by utilizing the
arch-specific @INC dir to store the path to rsync itself.

NOTE:  If you installed 0.18, the install path was incorrect.  You will
most likely need to 'make install UNINST=1' to clean up properly.

See the Changelog for details of all changes.

QUICK START GUIDE:

   Install rsync if you haven't already.

   Build/test/install File::Rsync

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install
   
   Once installed you can use 'perldoc File::Rsync' to get the rest of the
   documentation.  Or if you'd prefer to examine the docs before installation
   try 'perldoc -F Rsync.pm'.

This module is an attempt to efficiently handle the possibly numerous arguments
to the rsync command, and it's error conditions and messages.
