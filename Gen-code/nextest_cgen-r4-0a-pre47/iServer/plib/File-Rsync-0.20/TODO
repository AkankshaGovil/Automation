Add example code to manpage

Figure out a scheme for including extended docs.  The new perl-style options
      add a great deal of flexibility.  The ability to pass an array reference
      to the 'source' option, and the include/exclude options means you can
      build your own lists and pass them to the object when you are ready.  I
      need to figure out a good (standard) way to include docs on this so
      people don't have to figure this out the hard way.  Extended examples
      should also be included (like one using Find.pm to build a complex
      include/exclude list).

Other suggestions welcome
