Fri Sep  7 15:18:58 CDT 2001  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.20: made changes to test.pl so failed tests would
      return non-zero exit and actually fail the tests.  Also corrected
      several type-os in the POD documentation (thanks to Joe SMith
      <Joe.Smith@wcom.com> for pointing them out).

Wed May 16 21:11:31 CDT 2001  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.19: discovered the new makefile was installing
      into the wrong path.  It should follow the proper naming convention
      now.

Thu May 10 22:28:28 CDT 2001  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.18: Many thanks to Andreas Koenig
      <andreas.koenig@dubravka.kbx.de> for setting me straight on the
      architecture specific versus the arch-independent directory usage,
      and for explaining why this wasn't showing up in the by-module
      listings.  The tar file now has a recognizable .pm file in it for
      proper CPAN distribution.  There is also a File::Rsync::Config.pm
      in the arch-specific dir where the build process stores the path
      to the rsync executable.

Mon May  7 01:07:44 CDT 2001  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.17: I decided it is better for the out and err methods
      to return any collected output regardless of whther or not an output
      function has been defined.  This way you can process each line yourself
      and still print the entire output in bulk if desired.  This also
      keeps me from having to work out what these methods should return
      if called when an output function has been defined.

Thu Feb 15 21:25:23 CST 2001  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.16: James Mello <kingjamm@colltech.com> submitted a patch
      to add a 'list' function, and educated me on the interesting aspect
      of calling rsync without a destination in order to obtain an 'ls -l'
      or 'ls -lr' (with -r or -a) style output.  Rather than duplicating
      the exec function I made modifications to it and built a wrapper
      to get the list functionality.  This has all kinds of possibilities.
      Many thanks to James for the great idea and the education on an
      option I had never explored.

      use File::Rsync;$rs=File::Rsync->new(srchost => 'localhost:');
      print $rs->list; will list available modules on the local daemon.

      * version 0.15: After more thought and discussion with Boris we decided
      a second arg of either 'out' or 'err' should be passed to the functions
      so a single user-defined function could be used and it will be able to
      determine the source of the text in arg 1.  Simple functions can ignore
      the second arg.  The examples below would need to change to 'outfun =>
      sub {print shift}' and 'errfun => sub {print shift}' to keep from
      printing the source string. (version 0.14 was not released to CPAN)

Fri Nov 17 23:03:00 CST 2000  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.14: Per suggestion from Boris Goldowsky
      <boris@range.infoplease.com>, added 'outfun' and 'errfun' options.
      If you supply a function (CODE) reference to these the stderr and stdout
      from rsync is passed to these functions one output line at a time and
      is not collected internally for post examination.  Providing a function
      like 'outfun => sub {print @_}' will cause each line to be printed as
      they arrive.  A function like 'outfun => sub {print "."}' will simply
      shows progress dots like cpio's -V option.  Thanks to Boris for the
      suggestion.  Sorry it took me so long to get it added.

Sat Sep 16 23:32:59 CDT 2000  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.13: added suport for new flags blocking-io and ignore-errors,
      as well as scalars bwlimit, max-delete, and modify-window.  I also
      rearranged the options hashes into a vertical sort similar to 'ls'.
      This makes additions a bit more difficult, but makes reading and
      verifying the options much easier (at least for me).

Tue Feb 29 17:41:14 CST 2000  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.12: pervious version fixed blocking, but was not clean
      and caused the tests to fail in odd ways.  This should be better.

      * also added code to treat underscore the same as hyphen in option keys
      similar to Tk.  This allows the use of bareword keys in hashes without
      being mis-interpreted as subraction.

Fri Feb 18 17:45:13 CST 2000  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.11: fixed a blocking problem in the exec function
      If one of the output pipes filled up it hung forever (oops).

Mon Feb  7 14:05:37 CST 2000  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.10: removed comments about rsync not considering some things
      to be errors.  This appears to be a bug in 2.3.2 on Linux.  It has been
      submitted to the rsync team.  On Solaris rsync properly returns a non-zero
      exit status if the source path does not exist.  The bug was fixed in the
      CVS tree, and in the release 2.4.1.

      * added support for --backup-dir and --existing options (new in 2.4.1)

      * Since I've not heard from anyone about keeping the command-line style
      options, I've dropped them.  The hash-style affords more flexibility
      anyway.  I also removed some duplicate code in parseopts since I can now
      treat all args as a hash.

      * After some discussion on the rsync mailing list I was told about a
      method of passing multiple source arguments for a remote server.  I've
      added a new hash key 'srchost' to be used in combination with the 'source'
      array to make it easier to use this capability.  If the source host is
      remote, and you have multiple source paths, you can put the source
      hostname in 'srchost', and the paths in the 'source' array.  The module
      will assemble them as a single argument to rsync.  If 'srchost' is null
      then the 'source' array is passed to exec as seperate arguments.

Wed Dec  1 21:55:44 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.09: removed bareword keys in hashes (5.00404 doesn't like
      my use of 'scalar' as a key)

      * version 0.08: changed test 5 in test.pl to account for different
      return status between Solaris and Linux.  I'll need to look into why
      one detects the error and the other doesn't (rsync itself, not perl).

Tue Nov 30 20:46:00 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.07:

      * removed global $pkgname, now uses 'my $pkgname=ref $self' instead.
      I also had to bless $self earlier in 'new' so defopts, and parseopts can
      use 'ref $self' to determine the package name.  It was not too bright
      to hardcode the package name (vacations can have odd effects on the brain)

      * changed saveopts and parseopts to begin with underscore since they
      are for internal use only.

Sun Nov 28 19:41:31 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.06:

      * added $pkgname for 'carp' messages to make it clearer where they came
      from.

      * added missing check for 'include' in exec method

      * other misc cleanup and clarification of code and documentation

Sun Nov 28 02:47:34 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.05: major re-organization and re-writing of internal
      functions to add the ability to pass a hash reference for perl-style
      options handling.  (Thanks to Greg Ward for the suggestion)  This gives
      increased flexibility including the ability to turn off boolean flags,
      and to build your own include or exclude list as an array and pass a
      reference to the array to the module.  The same can be done for source
      paths.  

      * removed leading double-dashes from the option keys.  It is easier to
      add them in the parser for command-line style than to remove them for
      perl-style hashes.

      * changed 'err' and 'out' methods to return an empty string or an empty
      list if no output was generated.  If there was output they return it as
      an array or a reference to an array as before.  This should make testing
      for the existance of output more efficient.  Before you had to call them
      in a scalar context and dereference the return in order to check.  Now
      you can use a simple truth test.  Also added a note about conditions
      where rsync itself can return a true (0) exit but the programmer may
      consider it an error.  In these situations you need to check stderr for
      error messages (such as 'no such file or directory').  See 'exec' method
      in the manpage.

      * removed newlines from carp messages so the 'at <prog> line ##' is on
      the same line as the rest of the error message (bad habit from die).

      * changed all return values except 'new' to zero instead of undef so
      -w won't complain about use of un-initialized values.  If anyone has
      a good reason to put this back (like good/standard coding practices) let
      me know.

      * added test.pl script for 'make test'.

Sun Nov 21 02:18:56 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.04: added missing 'next' that would cause a parsing
      error if -P was used.

      * Renamed module to File::Rsync (Thanks to Tim Bunce for the suggestion)
      It really fits better here than in Net::, but once I thought of it
      as a network-based program I had a mental block when considering other
      groups.

Fri Nov 19 13:25:18 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.03: --address should be a scalar, not a flag (the
      rsync man page is unclear on this).

Wed Nov 17 21:20:16 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.02:

      * wrote first draft of Makefile.PL and makepm.PL to wrap it all up
      as a real perl module.

      * added new options for rsync 2.3.2 (-P, --delete-after, and
      --address)
      -P is short for --partial and --progress. --address is only
      used in server mode.  I don't know what good these are inside
      this module, but you should still be able to pass them if you
      want.
      --delete-after allows the user to delay any --delete actions
      until after all other files are synced.  The default is to
      perform any deletes before in order help insure sufficient disk
      space is available.  See the rsync (1) man page for more
      details.

      * remove any chance of clobbering $_ (mostly paranoia I hope)

Tue Jun 15 15:27:20 CDT 1999  Lee Eakin  <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com>

      * version 0.01: (initial) based on rsync 2.3.1
