DESCRIPTION

  XML::Simple - Easy API to read/write XML (esp config files)


  ******* WARNING ******* WARNING ******* WARNING ******* WARNING *******

   This release (1.08_01) is a beta release to allow the new SAX code to
   be tested on as many platforms as possible.  Please try it out if you
   can and report success/failure to the author.

   For production systems, please use the latest stable release (1.08)

  ******* WARNING ******* WARNING ******* WARNING ******* WARNING *******


PREREQUISITES

  XML::Simple requires a module capable of parsing XML - either XML::SAX or
  XML::Parser must be installed (if you're running ActivePerl, you'll
  already have XML::Parser installed).

  To generate documents with namespaces, XML::NamespaceSupport is required.

  The optional caching features of XML::Simple also require Storable.pm.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  If for some reason, you can't run these commands, you can simple copy 
  the Simple.pm file to your lib/XML directory (where Parser.pm lives).

  If you want to test the module, but don't have 'make', try:

      perl maketest


STATUS

  This version (1.08_01) is a beta release - to allow testing of the new
  SAX code.  If you encounter any problems installing or running this
  release, please email the author the complete output of 'make test'
  (even if your problem does not occur at this point).

  The current stable release is version 1.08.  This version is
  believed to be thread-safe.

  Please send any feedback to the author: grantm@cpan.org
