	* Version 3.02 of Net::Telnet released

	* Telnet.pm : Squelched silly warning introduced by perl5.005

	* Telnet.pm : Fixed incorrect handling of CR LF when chars are
	sent in separate blocks.

	* Telnet.pm : Modified log routines to accept a tied filehandle.

	* get() : Fixed to correctly set timed_out() to indicate no
	time-out error when data is not immediately available but
	subsequently arrives and is read before the time-out interval
	expires.

	* get() : Fixed timeout error when timeout=0, and no data read,
	but there's still data in the buffer yet to be returned.

	* get() : Errmode action now happens when timeout=0 and time-out
	occurs.

	* Version 3.01 of Net::Telnet released

	* binmode() : PLEASE NOTE - calling without an argument no longer
 	sets binmode to 1, but rather just returns the current value for
 	binmode.

	* telnetmode() : PLEASE NOTE - calling without an argument no
 	longer sets telnetmode to 1, but rather just returns the current
 	value for telnetmode.

	* cmd() : Removes the first line of output when the remote side
 	told us it would echo or the user requests its removal explicitly
 	with cmd_remove_mode()

	* cmd_remove_mode() : New method that contains the mode for how to
 	deal with an echoed back command in the output returned by cmd().
  	Default is set to "auto", which means cmd() removes the first line
 	of output when the remote side told us it would echo.

	* new() : By default, an offer to echo made by the remote side of
 	a TELNET connection is always accepted.

	* new() : Fixed default prompt to work with prompts containing $

	* fhopen() : Changed to work with any open filehandle including
 	uni-directional pipes like STDIN.

	* host() : When passed a null string or undef for a hostname it no
 	longer changes it to "localhost".

	* waitfor() : Now performs error mode action when eof is
 	encountered before the pattern match.

	* waitfor() : Changed text of error messages when timing-out.

	* login() : Changed text of error messages when timing-out.

	* Telnet.pm : Fixed non-portable use of \r\n to the more portable
 	\015\012.

	* break() : Fixed to no longer send the output_record_separator.

	* Telnet.pm : Stopped erroneously converting input character
 	sequences which look like TELNET escaped carriage-returns
	(\015\000), when not in telnetmode.

	* buffer() : New method that returns scalar reference to object's
 	input buffer.

	* buffer_empty() : New method that discards all data in object's
 	input buffer.

	* option_accept() : New method used to indicate our willingness to
 	accept a telnet option offered by the remote side.

	* option_callback() : New method used to receive notification of
 	telnet option negotiation.

	* option_log() : New method that is used to log option
 	negotiation.

	* option_state() : New method that returns the current state of a
 	telnet option.
