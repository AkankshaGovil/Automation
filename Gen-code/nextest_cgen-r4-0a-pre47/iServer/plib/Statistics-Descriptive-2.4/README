This new version (2.4) of Statistics::Descriptive contains:

- Code to correctly calculate the percentile of the data as defined by
  RFC2330.  Also included is RFC2330 for general reference.

List of methods by class:

Statistics::Descriptive::Sparse
----------------------------------
add_data
count
mean
sum
variance
pseudo_variance
min
max
mindex
maxdex
standard_deviation
sample_range

Statistics::Descriptive::Full
----------------------------------
All methods above and:
get_data
sort_data
presorted
percentile
median
trimmed_mean
harmonic_mean
mode
geometric_mean
frequency_distribution
least_squares_fit

Ideas for ongoing development:

- re: Georg Fuellen
  A function to define the "maxima" of a distribution.  In other words,
  return an array that contains all data that falls within a given
  confidence interval.

- Move source to C and XS for speed improvements. (Interface to R or S?)

- Move to PDL for a unified math solution and maybe take advantage of
  their compact storage.

- Methods for covariance and correlation.

- An interface to Jon Orwant's Statistics::ChiSquare module to
  provide a method for determining how random data is (for a uniform
  distribution) or how well is fits another distribution (for
  non-uniform distributions like normal(gaussian), log-normal,
  rayleigh, etc).

  The major issue I'm concerned about is the updating of someone else's
  code and future extensibility.  Now, major paranoia should be obvious
  since Jon hasn't changed Statistics::ChiSquare for a long, long
  time.  Still, a wrapper module that inherits from several other
  modules is appealing.  Perhaps it will be called Statistics::Bundle.
