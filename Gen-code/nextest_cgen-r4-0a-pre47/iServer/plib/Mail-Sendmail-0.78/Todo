Add install.ppm for PPM installs

Also MIME-encode headers if they contain accented characters

During Makefile.PL, try to find a local SMTP server and the user's e-mail 
address, and offer to pre-configure these as defaults in Sendmail.pm. And 
let the user enter defaults to override automatic detection.

Document $address_rx: which addresses it finds OK, and which not.

Use 8BITMIME if available from server?

Encode only if accented chars really present?

Add example scripts for CGI forms

Rename to Mail::Simple?

Setup Perl on an Amiga and see if it runs. (it should)
