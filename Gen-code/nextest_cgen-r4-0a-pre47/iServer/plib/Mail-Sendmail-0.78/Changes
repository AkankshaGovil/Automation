Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Sendmail.

Thanks to the people who helped between versions with suggestions or
reporting bugs: Chris Nandor, Paul J. Schinder, "kybl", Kenneth Lee,
Francisco, Chris Hostetter, Perrin Harkins, Tim Ward, ... and many
others! (I can't any more keep track of all the people who send me
usefull comments, but I do read them and thank everybody!)

0.78  25.09.2000
      - Now accepts single-letter host/domain names in addresses. They were
        previously rejected, due to my misunderstanding of an RFC.
      - Removed smtp.site1.csi.com from the default servers. That server is
        not an open relay any more. This leaves only 'localhost' in the
        servers list.
0.77  28.03.99
      - If connection to 1st server failed, the others failed too, but
        only with certain Perl-version/OS combinations !?!.
        Fixed (hopefuly).
0.76  27.03.99
      - fixed bug which prevented trying other servers in list if
        connection to first failed.
      - fixed reporting of server in log.
0.75  27.03.99
      - you can now send attachments, html mail etc... your headers will
        be left alone.
      - can use a list of possible SMTP servers instead of a single one.
      - all configuration now grouped in a %mailcfg hash.
      - removes possible extra line-endings in headers.
      - e-mail address regex changes:
        . now accepts user@[xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]
        . now refuses commas (they are only valid in quoted strings
          which $address_rx does not support). Comma separated
          recipients lists now work even with no space after the comma.
      - if you used an X-mailer header, the Mail::Sendmail vwersion was
        appended. It isn't any more.
      - removed unnecessary BEGIN{} block.
      - no more warnings on empty Subject.
      - lots's of cleaning up in the code.
        
0.74  Fri Jul 31 14:50:54 1998
      - Fixed $/ problem: mailing would hang if caller had redefined
        the record separator. It's now locally set to "\015\012". 
      - corrected reading of %mail hash passed to sendmail: it would
        abort on a false value (the trap is clearly mentionned in the
        perl docs: shame on me!)
      - added configurable retries when failure to connect to server 
      - much more error checking
      - more warnings to STDERR, but only if running with -w flag.
      - changed $address_rx, so it accepts user@hostname, not only
        user@host.top, and also accepts weird but legal characters
      - Message body is now all of Message, Body and Text instead
        of the first not empty one (if you don't mind the final
        message being in random order, you can now be really sloppy
        when filling in the message from your script!).
      - use strict.
      - Added Makefile.PL.
      - updated doc

0.73: - Line endings changed again to be Mac compatible at last.
      - Automatic time zone detection.
      - Support for SMTP Port change for single messages.
      - Always default to quoted-printable encoding if possible.
      - Added $Mail::Sendmail::default_sender.
      
0.72: - Fixed line endings in Body to "\r\n".
      - MIME quoted-printable encoding is now automatic if needed.
      - Test script can now run unattended.

0.71: - Fixed Time Zone bug with AS port.
      - Added half-hour Time Zone support.
      - Repackaged with \n line endings instead of \r\n.
