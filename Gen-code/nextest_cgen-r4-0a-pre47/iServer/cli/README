General Note -

	The database used is a gdbm database, shared between cli, ls, vpns
	through lock files. This database does not have to be explicitly
	created. It can be copied using the 'cp' command.

	For the 500 release, there are two databases: netoid database and the
	vpn database. The netoid database is organized on (serialnumber,port
	number) as keys. The vpn database is organized on (vpn ids) as the keys.
	
1. Adding a Netoid:
	
	cli netoid add SerNo [portL [-portH] [VpnId Extn] [VpnId Extn] ...]

	The command must be used to add a netoid prior to any modifications
	or updates via the rest of the commands. 

	SerNo = string at most 64 char long
	portL, portH = specifies the range of ports for the netoid (integer)
	vpnId = string
	Extn = string

	example usages:

	cli netoid add 3336665 0-5
		-> Adds 6 netoids in the database, [3336665, 0], [3336665, 1]...
		-> port numbers start from 0
	cli netoid add 3336665 0
		-> Adds one netoid. Its attributes can be revised later by the
		   cli netoid vpns command.
	cli netoid add 3336665 2-3 453 6301 453 6302
		-> Adds two netoids, and configures their vpn extensions 
		   respectively. [3336665, 2, 453-6301] [3336665, 3, 453-6302]
		-> Vpn 453 is also added or verified.
	
2. Configuring Vpn Phone Numbers for netoids

	cli netoid vpns SerNo [portL [-portH] [VpnId Extn] [VpnId Extn] ...]
		-> similar to a netoid add command except it changes the
		   extensions of already existing netoids.

3. Configuring Real Phone Numbers for netoids

	cli netoid lines SerNo [portL [-portH] [PhoneNumber] [PhoneNumber] ...]	

	example usages:

	cli netoid lines 3336665 2-3 3017210881 3017210882

		->Configures phone numbers for two netoids: 
		  [3336665, 2, 3017210881], [3336665, 2, 3017210882].

4. Listing the database
	
	cli netoid list

5. Listing the Lookup server and Vpns cache

	cli netoid cache

6. Modifying the properties of the netoids

	cli netoid props

7. Adding a New Vpn Id

	cli vpn add VpnId VpnExtLen

	examples:
		cli vpn add 453 4
			-> Adds a vpn id 453 with extension lengths of 4.

8. Listing the databse information

	cli db info

		This will list the location of the databases, and lock files.

Less frequently used commands:

	cli db org

		This command re-organizes a database for disk space. Useful
		when a lot of deletions have been made.


INSTALLATION:

1. Create directory "/databases".
2. Root access is necessary.
3. Create "/locks" directory (Root access is necessary for this operation also).
4. Any environment variables.
5. ls, vpns, lsage, cli to be installed in "/usr/local/netoids/bin".
6. Enhance PATH to include /usr/local/netoids/bin
7.
