<h2>
Introduction</h2>
LCR (Least Cost Routing) is a policy implemented on the callee to make
the call such that it has the least cost
<br>to the user.&nbsp; The following is the LCR sequence used by the callee
on any 1 phone number:
<ul>
<li>
Serplex lookup (LUS/VPNS)</li>

<li>
H.323 Gatekeeper (ARQs)</li>

<li>
Default Voip router (H.323)</li>

<li>
Line (PSTN/ITSP).</li>
</ul>
In the presence of rollover numbers, the same sequence is executed on each
number. For example, if iedge A wants
<br>to call phone P, it first looks up the serplex, and obtains (P,Q),
where P is the primary phone number/Ip address mapping,
<br>and Q is the rollover number/IP address mapping for phone P. A few
examples are as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<h5>
Scenario 1 : iEdge A calls phone P. P is an invalid number</h5>
The iedge first tries LUS, GK in order, and gets a not-found. Then it attempts
to make a call to the Default
<br>Voip Router (ie510), which puts the call on the line port. If all ports
on the 510 are busy, it rejects the call (this may happen,
<br>if the default voip router is an invalid ip address). If the router
is not defined, this step is fixed. Finally the 500 puts the call
<br>on the PSTN port and tries ITSP (in case P was a VPN phone number,
it would route the call on PSTN).
<h5>
Scenario 2: iEdge A calls P. P is forwarded to Q. Q is a PSTN number (ex.73014424001)</h5>
LUS will return Q in this case, when P is looked up, but without an IP&nbsp;address.
After going through the LCR sequence (see
<br>scenario 1), the iEdge finally puts the call on ITSP.
<h5>
Scenario 3: iEdge A calls P, P has a rollover number Q.</h5>
In case LUS replies with an IP address for P, iEdge calls P. If P gives
back a busy (this wont be heard), or does not
<br>answer for 4 rings, the iEdge removes P from his list of phone numbers
to try (it assumes that P does not want to answer).
<br>In case P is aged out, the iedge tries calling Q (but keeps P in its
list). If LUS returned an IP address for Q, the iEdge attempts
<br>to set up the call. If there is no Ip address, the iedge moved back
to P and attempts to look it up on the Gatekeeper. After this
<br>the next attempt is to look up Q on the gatekeeper, failing which the
iEdge again tries P with the default Voip router. Thus the LCR
<br>sequence is exercised for each phone in turn, in a breadth first manner.
