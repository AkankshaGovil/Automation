<h2>
Introduction</h2>
There are 3 types of call forwarding (in order of decreasing predence):
<ul>
<li>
Proxy forwarding to PC.</li>

<li>
*4 Forwarding.</li>

<li>
Call Rollover</li>
</ul>
All three types may be simultaneously enabled. However only one is active
at a given time, based on predence.
<h4>
*4 Forwarding</h4>
&nbsp;
<table BORDER=3 CELLPADDING=5 COLS=2 WIDTH="500" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" NOSAVE >
<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE>*4 VPN Extension #</td>

<td>Forwarding to a VPN number</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE>*4 7 Phone Number #</td>

<td NOSAVE>Forwarding to intranet number (LUS or Gatekeeper), PSTN number
or ITSP number&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The phone number entered by the user using the keypad is first looked
up on the relevent server (depending on the number).
<br>For example, a vpn number will be looked up on the VPNS. From this
either the number may be determined as not found, or
<br>its corresponding phone number will be obtained from the server (if
it is configured on the VPNS). These numbers obtained
<br>will be sent to both servers, to enable forwarding.
<p>iedge <i>E </i>is forwarding to a phone X. X is looked up on the relevent
server, and returns P
<br>or V. The fact that X may be also forwarded is irrelevent, as this
lookup is only one level.
<table BORDER=3 CELLPADDING=5 COLS=3 WIDTH="500" NOSAVE >
<tr>
<td>X is a VPN phone.</td>

<td>X->P, X->V</td>

<td>P is sent to LUS,
<br>V is sent to VPNS</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td>X is a VPN phone.</td>

<td>X->V</td>

<td NOSAVE>V is sent to VPNS. LUS only knows that the iedge is forwarded.
The iedge may become unreachable from outside in this case.</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE>X is a phone</td>

<td>X -> P</td>

<td>P is sent to LUS, P is sent to VPNS. If someone from inside a VPN tries
to call X, it will eventually try P (an external phone).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Note: If the iedge has no phone number, no forwarding information will
be sent to the LUS. Similar case for VPNS.
<h4>
Call Rollover</h4>
Call rollover is a configuration on the iedge, which the iedge registers
with the server. The rollover number is used in
<br>situations where the primary number is busy, goes unanswered, is aged
out, not registered, or down. Call rollover number
<br>is used by the callee in association with executing its own&nbsp; <a href="lcr.html">LCR</a>&nbsp;
policy.
<p>Usage of call rollover numbers by the callee is restricted to just one
level to prevent unintended rollovers. For example,
<br>if A looks up P, and P is rolled over to X, and X is rolled over to
Y, the lookups will stop at X. However if X is forwarded
<br>to Y the lookup will return Y.
<h4>
Proxy Forwarding</h4>
Proxy forwarding is available for forwarding from an iedge to a PC only.
<br>The iedge informs the serplex, that someone will proxy for it, using
a key sequence (*6). For security reasons a PIN
<br>may be provided, as *6 PIN #. The PIN&nbsp;can be at most 20 characters,
and is optional.
<p>The iedge need not specify any phone number at the time of enabling
proxy forwarding. A PC may be used now,
<br>to register on behalf of this iedge. The iedge phone number of the
port on which the proxy is enabled (or the vpn phone
<br>number) and the PIN&nbsp;(if applicable) is needed, to do proxy registration.
After this all calls to the iedge will be forwarded
<br>to the PC, until either the PC unregisters (as proxy), or the iedge
turns off proxy forwarding by (**6).
