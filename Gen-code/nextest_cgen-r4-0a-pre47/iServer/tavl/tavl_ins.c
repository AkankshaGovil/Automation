 *  Module:     tavl_insert
 *  Purpose:    Insert item into TAVL_TREE;  "item" may be anything,
 *              but the user-defined function "key_of()" given when tree was
 *              initialized by "tavl_init()" must be able to read an
 *              identifier from "item" which can be compared with other
 *              indentifiers via the user defined function "cmp()".
 *
 *              If a datanode is found such that identifier(datanode) equals
 *              identifier(item), the new data from item replaces the data
 *              existing in datanode if & only if parameter replace == 1.
 *
 * !!NOTE!!     Programs that use this module must also link in the module
 *              whose source is in the file "TAVLREBL.C".
