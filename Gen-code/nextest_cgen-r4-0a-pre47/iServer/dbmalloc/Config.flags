# This file is used by the configure script to determine the flags that should
# be specified for each compiler as the configuration is determined.  The
# compiler *MUST* start in column one and the flags must be on the same line
#
# For example, if you wanted to add -pedantic to gcc (although this would
# probably cause the configure to fail because it is so restrictive) you
# would add the following line:
#
gcc
#
# Note that the g in gcc would be in column 1
#
# By default, the compilers use no flags and therefore are not specified here
#
