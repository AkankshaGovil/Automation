The following is the list of changes that one has to perform
when configuring the rsync package. 

### Create /etc/rsyncd.conf e.g. as shown below

#motd file = /etc/motd
max connections = 5
log file = /tmp/rsync.log
syslog facility = local5
dont compress = * *.*

[nextone]
    comment = nextone area
    path = /export/home/test
    use chroot
    read only = no
#   auth users = ptyagi, root
#   secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets
    uid = root
    gid = root
    timeout = 300

###  If authentication is enabled then need to create
###  secrets file with username:password entries. 
###  However, each time we log, this password will be
###  queried. A better mechanism is to limit the 
###  hosts by using the following primitive.
###  chroot limits the access to only that particular
###  directory

# host allow = host1, host2, host3

###  To configure rsync daemon
###  Add the following line to the /etc/services
rsync 		873/tcp
###  Add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf
rsync	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/bin/rsync rsync --daemon
